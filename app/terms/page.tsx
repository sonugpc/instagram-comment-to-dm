        <p className="mt-3">
          You may use CampaignCue only with Instagram professional accounts you
          own or are authorized to manage. You are responsible for the campaigns,

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Platform Compliance</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          You agree to follow Meta Platform Terms, Instagram policies, applicable
          messaging rules, privacy laws, advertising rules, and anti-spam laws.
          CampaignCue may rate-limit, pause, or disable campaigns that create

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Billing</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Paid plans are billed through Stripe. Plan access is provisioned from
          Stripe webhook events. Cancellations, failed payments, and subscription
          changes may change plan limits or reduce access to paid features.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Availability</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          CampaignCue depends on third-party platforms including Meta, Stripe,
          email, hosting, database, and queue providers. We work to operate the
          service reliably, but uninterrupted availability is not guaranteed.
