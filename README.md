# CampaignCue

Open-source Instagram comment-to-DM campaign OS for businesses, creators, and agencies.

CampaignCue turns comments like `LINK`, `PRICE`, or `GUIDE` into Meta-compliant private replies. The core engine is MIT licensed and self-hostable. The hosted SaaS layer is being built for agencies that want campaign templates, analytics, client reports, and managed reliability.

## Why This Exists

Instagram comment-to-DM is one of the clearest social-commerce loops:

```text
Customer comments "LINK" on a post or reel
Meta sends a webhook
CampaignCue matches the keyword
The worker sends a private reply using the comment ID
The business gets a warm conversation
```

Most tools in this market are broad chatbot platforms. CampaignCue is intentionally narrower: a focused campaign operating system for Instagram comment-triggered DMs.

## Current Product

- Email magic-link signup with workspace tenancy.
- Instagram professional account connection as an integration.
- Keyword campaigns for posts and reels.
- Meta webhook verification and event storage.
- BullMQ worker for private reply delivery.
- Idempotent DM logs per campaign/comment.
- Atomic monthly usage reservations and Redis-backed hourly DM reservations.
- Stripe Checkout, Customer Portal, and subscription webhooks.
- Plan limits for campaigns and monthly DMs.
- Vercel cron for token refresh and usage maintenance.
- Health checks and authenticated production diagnostics.
- Public Privacy, Terms, Data Deletion, and Meta App Review support pages.
- Production deployment docs for Vercel, Railway, Postgres, and Redis.

## Demo

The landing page is available locally at:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Screenshots and GIFs are planned in issue [#17](https://github.com/im-anishraj/instagram-comment-to-dm/issues/17). Good launch assets to add:

- Landing page hero screenshot.
- Dashboard overview screenshot.
- Campaign builder screenshot.
- Logs page screenshot.
- 30 second "comment LINK -> private reply" demo GIF using a Meta test account.

## Hosted SaaS

The hosted product will focus on agencies and campaign teams:

- Managed Vercel/Railway infrastructure.
- Public campaign templates.
- Tracked links and click analytics.
- Shareable client reports.
- Multi-account agency workspaces.
- Priority support and onboarding.

The core remains public so builders can self-host, audit, fork, and contribute.
